Description: Flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP 
 Fast: Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code.
 The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.
 .
 Secure: Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code.
 This allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where
 users may modify the template design.
 .
 Flexible: Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser.
 This allows the developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and
 create its own DSL.

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${php:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Binary bits for twig (currently, the C code that implements
